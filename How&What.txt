Should You Create a Personal Branch?
################################################

""A PERSONAL BRANCH allows you to work independently without affecting shared branches, 
making it safer to experiment and develop features.​

""The DRAFT BRANCH is for team-wide pre-final integration. 
Individual changes should be merged to DRAFT only when ready for group review.

""Creating a personal branch for yourself, and encouraging each member to do so, 
is highly recommended for larger teams, as it keeps code organized and minimizes conflicts.​


Key GitHub Concepts Explained
################################################

""Branch: 
A branch is an isolated workspace for development within the same repository. 
Each branch can have its own changes and only affects the main code when merged.​

""Fork:
A fork is a complete copy of a repository into your account—you use 
this typically for contributing to someone else's project. Your team likely won’t need 
to fork if everyone has access to the same repository.​

""Commit: 
Saving snapshots of your work with a meaningful message describing what changed.

""Pull Request (PR):
When your branch is ready, you propose merging it into another branch via a PR. 
Draft PRs allow your code to be reviewed before committing to the main or FINAL branch.​






Step-by-Step Guide for Saving Work and Collaboration
################################################################################################################################################
1. Clone the Repository
Open GitHub Desktop and log in.​
Go to File > Clone repository and select your team project.

2. Create a Personal Branch
In the repository view, click Branch > New Branch.​
Name your branch (e.g., feature-yourname).
Switch to your branch before making changes.

3. Make Your Changes
Use VS Code to edit files.
Save changes locally as you work.

4. Commit Changes
In GitHub Desktop, review changed files.
Write a clear commit summary—describe what you’ve done.
Click Commit to <your branch>.

5. Push Your Changes to GitHub
Click Push origin to upload your commits to GitHub.

6. Merge into DRAFT
When ready, switch to the DRAFT branch in GitHub Desktop.
From your personal branch, click Branch > Merge into current branch to integrate your work into DRAFT.
Push changes to update DRAFT on GitHub.

7. Move from DRAFT to FINAL
The team reviews DRAFT.
Once approved, merge DRAFT into FINAL to represent the finished, polished codebase.

8. Using Pull Requests
On GitHub web, create a Pull Request from your branch or DRAFT to FINAL for team discussion and approval before merging.​

Tips for Beginners
################################################################################################################################################
Branches are cheap—create as many as needed, and delete when done.​
Forks are for working independently or contributing to external repositories, not usually needed for teams with shared access.​
Always pull upstream changes before you start work to stay up-to-date.​
Communicate branch purpose in commit messages and branch names.
This guide will help team members navigate GitHub and VS Code effectively, promoting better collaboration and code management.
